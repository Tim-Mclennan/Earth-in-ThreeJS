# Earth-in-ThreeJS

![Earth (demo screenshot)](image.png)

Earth-in-ThreeJS is an immersive 3D visualization of Earth, built using the Three.js library. It was a fun project in which I got to test out some of my skills in ThreeJS.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   `git clone https://github.com/tim-mclennan/Earth-in-ThreeJS`

2. Install NPM packages:

    `npm install`

### Running the Application

   `npm start`

The application will be available on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## <a name="Project-Structure">Project Structure</a>

The project is structured to facilitate easy development and maintenance. Key directories include:

- `src/`: Contains the JavaScript modules for the Earth visualization, including the main scene setup, lighting, textures, and effects.
- `textures/`: Stores the texture images used for the Earth's surface, clouds, and night lights.
- `public/`: Contains the static files such as `index.html` and the entry point `index.js`.

## <a name="Features">Features</a>

Earth-in-ThreeJS offers a range of features to explore the Earth in 3D:

- **Interactive Rotation**: Users can rotate the Earth to view it from different angles.
- **Zoom**: Zoom in and out to get a closer look at specific regions.
- **Day/Night Cycle**: Simulates the Earth's rotation with a day/night cycle.
- **Clouds and Atmospheric Effects**: Realistic clouds and atmospheric glow effects.
- **Starfield Background**: A dynamic starfield adds depth to the scene.

## <a name="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a>
